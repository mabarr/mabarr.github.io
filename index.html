         <p> Athens has all sorts of places to explore. One of the most popular is the Acropolis, an ancient city of ruins that contains Parthenon.
The Parthenon is almost 2,500 years old and you get to walk around it. Rad. Here is a pro tip for visiting the Parthenon from the travel blog <a href="https://www.earthtrekkers.com/how-to-visit-the-acropolis-parthenon-in-athens/"> Earthtrekkers:</a> "Ticket lines can be very long, especially midday. Consider purchasing the combination ticket at one of the lesser visited archeological sites and use this to bypass the ticket line into the Acropolis. If lines are long, it may be worth â‚¬10 to avoid waiting an hour to purchase your tickets."  <a href="http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/downloads/guides"> Click Here for an Official Guide!</a>
